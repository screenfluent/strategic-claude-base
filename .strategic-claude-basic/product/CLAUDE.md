## File Structure Overview

The product directory contains comprehensive product documentation generated by the `/create_product_roadmap` command. Each file serves a specific purpose in documenting the complete product vision, architecture, and roadmap.

## File Types and Purposes

### Required Files

#### **PRD.md** - Product Requirements Document
- Executive summary and problem statement
- Goals, objectives, and success metrics
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Technical requirements and dependencies
- Implementation plan with phases
- Risks, mitigations, and success criteria

#### **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System Architecture
- Overview and design principles
- System architecture diagrams (ASCII/mermaid)
- Component details and interfaces
- Data flow and interactions
- Directory structure
- Performance characteristics
- Security considerations
- Technical decisions and rationale

#### **ROADMAP.md** - Product Roadmap
- Vision statement and strategic direction
- Current state assessment
- Roadmap overview with timeline visualization
- Detailed phase breakdowns with milestones
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Risk management strategies
- Release schedule and criteria
- Community engagement and governance

### Optional Files

#### **REFERENCES.md** - Local Repository References
- **Only created when local codebases need to be referenced**
- Path references to related local repositories
- Code examples and implementation patterns
- Usage guidelines for referenced code
- Directory contents and structure explanations

## File Naming Convention

Unlike research and plan documents, product documentation uses simple, descriptive filenames:

```
PRD.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
ROADMAP.md
REFERENCES.md (optional)
```

**Rationale**: Product documentation represents the canonical, living specification for a project. Simple names make these core documents easily discoverable and memorable.

## Content Standards

### Quality Requirements
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Each file should fully address its domain
- **Professional Presentation**: Use proper formatting, diagrams, and structure
- **Actionable Content**: Include specific, measurable criteria and next steps
- **Strategic Alignment**: All documents should align with overall product vision
- **Technical Accuracy**: Architecture and implementation details must be precise

### Documentation Consistency
- Use consistent terminology across all files
- Maintain cross-references between related concepts
- Include file:line references for code examples
- Provide measurable success criteria
- Separate automated vs manual verification steps

## Usage by Claude Code

When using the `/create_product_roadmap` command:

1. **Accept Multiple Research Inputs**: Command can process multiple research documents as foundation
2. **Interactive Process**: Collaborate with user through multiple feedback cycles
3. **Comprehensive Research**: Use specialized agents to analyze codebase and requirements
4. **Template-Based Generation**: Use templates but customize for specific project needs
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Allow user to review and refine each document
6. **Cross-Document Consistency**: Ensure all files align and reference each other appropriately

## Integration with Development Process

Product documentation serves as the foundation for:
- Implementation planning and execution
- Architecture decisions and technical reviews
- Feature prioritization and roadmap updates
- Stakeholder communication and alignment
- Success measurement and milestone tracking

These documents should be updated as the product evolves, maintaining their role as the single source of truth for product direction and technical approach.
