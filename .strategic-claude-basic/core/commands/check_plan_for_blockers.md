You are tasked with analyzing implementation plans for potential blocking issues by examining the codebase, technical dependencies, related summaries, and research documents.

**Plan input provided:** $1

## Input Format Support

This command supports multiple input formats:

- **Single plan**: `/check_plan_for_blockers PLAN_0019_16-09-2025-tue_reed-solomon-aligned-strategy.md`
- **Multiple plans**: `/check_plan_for_blockers PLAN_0019_16-09-2025-tue_reed-solomon-aligned-strategy.md TEST_0019_16-09-2025-tue_rs-aligned-strategy-testing.md`
- **NNNN number**: `/check_plan_for_blockers 0019` (finds all plans with that number)
- **Multiple NNNN**: `/check_plan_for_blockers 0019 0020 0021`
- **With Codex analysis**: `/check_plan_for_blockers 0019 --with-codex` (adds alternative Codex perspective)

### Flag Options

- **--with-codex**: Enables dual-source analysis using the Codex MCP server for an alternative perspective on blockers and dependencies

## Initial Response

When this command is invoked:

1. **Check if plan input was provided**:

   - If plan input provided, proceed with analysis
   - If no input provided, respond with:

   ```
   I'll analyze implementation plans for potential blocking issues by examining the codebase, dependencies, and related work.

   Please provide plan file(s) or NNNN number(s) to analyze:
   Examples:
   - Single plan: `/check_plan_for_blockers PLAN_0019_16-09-2025-tue_reed-solomon-aligned-strategy.md`
   - Multiple plans: `/check_plan_for_blockers PLAN_0019... TEST_0019...`
   - NNNN number: `/check_plan_for_blockers 0019`
   - Multiple NNNN: `/check_plan_for_blockers 0019 0020 0021`
   - With Codex analysis: `/check_plan_for_blockers 0019 --with-codex`

   I'll use codebase agents and optionally Codex analysis to identify blockers and propose plan updates.
   ```

   Then wait for the user's input.

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Plan Discovery and Validation

1. **Parse input arguments**:

   - If argument contains `.md`, treat as plan file path(s)
   - If argument is 4-digit number (NNNN), search for matching plans
   - Support space-separated multiple inputs
   - Check for `--with-codex` flag and set codex analysis mode

2. **Find and validate plan files**:

   ```bash
   # For NNNN inputs, find matching plans
   find .strategic-claude-basic/plan/ -name "*_NNNN_*" -type f

   # Validate plan files exist
   test -f ".strategic-claude-basic/plan/[plan-file]"
   ```

3. **Present plan discovery results**:

   ```
   Plan Discovery Results:
   Found [N] plan(s) for analysis:
   - PLAN_NNNN_date_subject.md ([implementation plan])
   - TEST_NNNN_date_subject.md ([test plan])

   Proceeding with blocker analysis...
   ```

### Step 2: Document Context Analysis

1. **Read all discovered plans completely**:

   - Extract implementation requirements and phases
   - Identify technical dependencies mentioned
   - Note file paths and components to be modified
   - Extract success criteria and prerequisites

2. **Find related documents**:

   **Summary Documents**:

   - Search for matching SUMMARY documents with same NNNN
   - Read summaries to understand current status and known issues
   - Extract incomplete work and technical debt

   **Research Documents**:

   - Search for matching RESEARCH documents
   - Read research to understand design decisions and constraints

3. **Present document context**:

   ```
   Document Context Analysis:
   Plans to analyze:
   - [Plan 1]: [brief description of scope]
   - [Plan 2]: [brief description of scope]

   Related documents found:
   - Summaries: [N] found ([completion status])
   - Research: [N] found ([topics covered])

   Proceeding with codebase dependency analysis...
   ```

### Step 3: Codebase Dependency Analysis

1. **Use codebase agents for deep analysis**:

   **For each plan, analyze dependencies using agents**:

   ```
   # Use codebase-locator to find relevant files
   Task: codebase-locator
   Prompt: "Find files related to [plan scope] including [key components from plan]"

   # Use codebase-analyzer for implementation details
   Task: codebase-analyzer
   Prompt: "Analyze implementation status and dependencies for [specific components]. Focus on interface compatibility, missing implementations, and integration points."

   # Use codebase-pattern-finder for similar implementations
   Task: codebase-pattern-finder
   Prompt: "Find existing patterns for [plan approach] that could guide or block implementation"
   ```

2. **Git history analysis**:

   ```bash
   # Check recent commits that might affect dependencies
   git log --oneline -20

   # Look for ongoing work that might conflict
   git status --porcelain

   # Check for unstaged changes in relevant areas
   git diff --name-only
   ```

### Step 4: Codex Alternative Analysis (if --with-codex flag present)

1. **Run Codex analysis for alternative perspective**:

   ```
   # Use Codex MCP server for deep architectural analysis
   mcp__codex__codex
   Prompt: "Analyze the following implementation plan(s) for potential blocking issues:

   [Plan content summary]

   Focus on:
   - Missing prerequisites and dependencies
   - Interface incompatibilities and API conflicts
   - Architectural concerns and design conflicts
   - Hidden dependencies not obvious from surface analysis
   - Performance bottlenecks and resource constraints
   - Integration challenges with existing systems
   - Testing infrastructure requirements
   - Potential regression risks

   Provide specific technical concerns with file paths and concrete examples where possible."
   ```

2. **Codex analysis advantages**:

   - **Architectural perspective**: Broader view of system interactions
   - **Pattern recognition**: Identifies anti-patterns and design conflicts
   - **Deep dependency analysis**: Finds non-obvious interdependencies
   - **Alternative viewpoint**: May catch issues standard analysis misses

3. **Present Codex findings**:

   ```
   Codex Alternative Analysis:
   🔍 Additional blockers identified:
   - [Codex-specific finding 1]
   - [Codex-specific finding 2]

   🔄 Conflicting assessments:
   - Standard analysis: [finding]
   - Codex analysis: [alternative view]

   ✅ Consensus issues (found by both):
   - [High-confidence blocker 1]
   - [High-confidence blocker 2]
   ```

### Step 5: Technical Blocker Identification

1. **Categorize potential blockers**:

   **Critical Blockers** 🔴:

   - Missing required dependencies
   - Incompatible interfaces or APIs
   - Test failures in prerequisite components
   - Conflicting ongoing work

   **Non-Critical Issues** 🟡:

   - Performance concerns
   - Technical debt
   - Minor API inconsistencies
   - Documentation gaps

   **Prerequisites** ⚠️:

   - Required setup or configuration
   - Dependency updates needed
   - Environmental requirements

2. **Test current codebase state**:

   ```bash
   # Run basic build check
   go build ./...

   # Check for linting issues in relevant areas
   golangci-lint run [relevant-paths]

   # Quick test check for critical components
   go test -short [relevant-packages]
   ```

### Step 6: Agent-Enhanced Analysis

1. **Use specialized agents for comprehensive analysis**:

   **For each identified dependency**:

   - **codebase-analyzer**: Analyze implementation completeness
   - **codebase-locator**: Find all related files and interfaces
   - **general-purpose**: Research complex integration points

2. **Cross-reference with known issues**:

   - Check summaries for unresolved critical issues
   - Look for TODO/FIXME comments in related code
   - Identify performance bottlenecks or limitations

### Step 7: Comprehensive Blocker Report with Plan Updates

1. **Generate consolidated blocker assessment**:

   ```
